## Healing Humanity — Impact Infrastructure on Sui

### One-liner

**Healing Humanity is a programmable trust layer for global social funding.**

Built on Sui, it enables **transparent, milestone-based capital deployment** for NGOs, donors, and institutions.

---

## The Problem

Global social funding suffers from:

* Opaque fund flows
* Manual compliance checks
* Post-hoc impact reporting
* Low trust between donors, NGOs, and auditors

Capital exists. Trust doesn’t.

---

## The Solution

Healing Humanity provides:

* On-chain campaign identity
* Programmable escrow for milestone funding
* AI-verified attestations
* Transparent fund release
* On-chain impact credentials

All enforced **natively at the protocol level**.

---

## Why Sui

Healing Humanity is built specifically for Sui because:

* Object-centric architecture matches real-world assets
* Parallel execution enables public participation
* Native shared objects enable safe public donations
* Strong asset semantics prevent fund misuse

This protocol **could not be built safely** on account-based chains.
